  <h2>2. Professional Relationship</h2>
  
  <h3>Not Medical Advice</h3>
  <p>Information on this website is for general educational purposes and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. A therapeutic relationship begins only after a formal intake session and written agreement.</p>

  <h3>Clinical Scope</h3>
  <p>Our services are designed for high-functioning professionals seeking optimization and addressing subclinical to moderate mental health concerns. Acute psychiatric emergencies, severe psychiatric disorders, and active substance dependence requiring medical detoxification are outside our scope and will be referred to appropriate facilities.</p>

  <h3>Medical Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>While our practitioner is a physician, services provided are psychotherapeutic in nature. </p>

  <h2>3. Confidentiality & Privacy</h2>
  
  <h3>Professional Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>All therapeutic communications are protected by medical confidentiality and professional ethics codes. Information shared during sessions will not be disclosed without your explicit written consent, except as required by law.</p>

  <h3>Legal Exceptions</h3>
  <p>Confidentiality may be limited in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Imminent risk of harm to self or others</li>
    <li>Suspected child or vulnerable adult abuse</li>
    <li>Court orders or legal proceedings requiring disclosure</li>
    <li>As required by applicable healthcare regulations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Protection</h3>
  <p>Personal and health data are processed in accordance with our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and applicable data protection regulations (GDPR, UK GDPR, etc.).</p>

  <h2>7. Results & Outcomes</h2>
  <p><strong>No Guaranteed Outcomes:</strong> While we employ evidence-based methods and track progress systematically, psychotherapy outcomes vary by individual. We cannot guarantee specific results or cure of any condition.</p>

  <p>Expected improvements (sleep quality, anxiety reduction, focus enhancement) are goals, not guarantees. Your engagement, adherence to protocols, and individual circumstances significantly influence outcomes.</p>

  <h2>8. Emergency Situations</h2>
  <p><strong>Not for Emergencies:</strong> Our services are not designed for psychiatric emergencies. In case of crisis:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact local emergency services (112 in EU, 911 in US, etc.)</li>
    <li>Visit the nearest emergency department</li>
    <li>Contact a crisis helpline in your jurisdiction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Between-session support is for routine check-ins, not emergency intervention.</p>
